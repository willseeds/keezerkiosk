--------------   KEEZER KIOSK   --------------

Keezer Kiosk project goal (1.0)

- with the ability to report temp from a sensor


// about @keezerkiosk
- Started 5.6.20 - 1.0 released 8.6.20
- Target Goal: create a simple 
- touch-management viewable website 
- for showing keezer contents and
- history for 2 to 8 taps. 

- include insert/update/delete ability on past/upcoming
- beers for easy brewing/keezer management.

  simple HTML pages (with .php extension)
   - use include/require to add functionality
   - leave out the ID and SQL stuff from the user
   - source pages and phpMySQLadmin tables contain SQL understanding
   - admin area for add/edit/delete
   - touch-only for users, admin will need keyboard/mouse
   - globals page for keezer name, tap count, colors

The site was designed to be accessible from an internal network's website sub-folder, but can be updated easily to work as the main site. Update the include file locations (../../ should be just ../ to go up one folder instead of two). This was design this way to allow the home-computing environment to use the website/database functionality without disturbing the keezer files. 

// WARNING 
This site was not designed for external exposure to the internet. Only for internal/local network. It should for no reason at all be exposed to the external internet. If you want to show friends/family take a picture or invite them over for a beer and surprise them.
